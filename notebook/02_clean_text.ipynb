    "Welcome to the \"Text Data Preprocessing\" notebook (02_clean_text) üìä. In this notebook, we will focus on the essential steps of text data preprocessing. Text data often requires various transformations to make it suitable for analysis and modeling. We'll perform tasks such as handling HTML entities, removing special characters, converting emojis, and more to prepare our text data for further analysis.\n",
